# Cursor Rules for AI Social Media Content Moderation

## Project Context
This is an AI-powered social media application built with Node.js and Express.js. The project implements AI/ML features for intelligent functionality.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+, Express.js 4.18+
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **AI/ML**: Custom algorithms, optional OpenAI integration
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Follow async/await pattern for asynchronous operations
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and constructors
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused

## AI/ML Development Guidelines
- Implement AI algorithms in separate service files
- Use clear mathematical notation in comments
- Optimize for performance (cache results when possible)
- Handle edge cases
- Document algorithm parameters
- Test with sample data

## API Development
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use consistent response formats: { success, data, message, error }
- Implement proper error handling with status codes
- Add input validation for all endpoints
- Use middleware for common operations

## Database Guidelines
- Use Mongoose schemas with proper validation
- Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries
- Handle database errors gracefully

## Security Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use JWT for authentication with proper expiration
- Implement CORS properly

## Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use database indexes strategically
- Optimize algorithm calculations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Monitor and log slow queries

## Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Return meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes

## Code Generation Preferences
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Use destructuring for object/array operations
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks

## AI Assistant Instructions
- When suggesting code, prioritize readability and maintainability
- Suggest performance optimizations when relevant
- Include error handling in code suggestions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Suggest improvements for algorithm efficiency
- Recommend best practices for Node.js/Express
- Consider scalability in code suggestions

## Common Patterns
- Use Express router for route organization
- Implement middleware chain: auth → validation → controller
- Use service layer for business logic separation
- Create utility functions for reusable operations
- Use environment-based configuration

## Dependencies to Consider
- express: Web framework
- mongoose: MongoDB ODM
- cors: Cross-origin resource sharing
- dotenv: Environment variables
- openai: Optional AI features
- nodemon: Development server

## Future Enhancements to Keep in Mind
- Advanced AI features
- Real-time updates
- Analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support
- Mobile app integration
