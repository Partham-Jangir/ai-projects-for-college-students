# Mobile Application Projects - AI Development Rules

## Project Context
This folder contains 25 cross-platform mobile applications with AI capabilities using React Native and Flutter.

## Technology Stack
- **Mobile Frameworks**: React Native, Flutter, Expo
- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow Lite, ML Kit, Core ML, OpenAI APIs
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase, AWS Amplify, Google Cloud
- **State Management**: Redux, MobX, Provider, Riverpod
- **Navigation**: React Navigation, Flutter Navigator

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for React Native projects
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines (Material Design for Android, Human Interface for iOS)
- Implement proper state management
- Write modular, reusable components
- Use proper naming conventions

### Mobile-Specific Best Practices
- Optimize for battery consumption
- Implement offline-first architecture where possible
- Handle network connectivity changes gracefully
- Optimize app size and loading times
- Test on both iOS and Android devices
- Implement proper permission handling

### AI Integration for Mobile
- Use on-device ML models when possible (TensorFlow Lite, ML Kit)
- Implement efficient image processing pipelines
- Cache AI results to reduce API calls
- Handle low-bandwidth scenarios
- Optimize model size for mobile deployment
- Implement progressive loading for AI features

```

### Testing Requirements
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Implement unit tests for business logic
- Test on multiple device sizes and orientations
- Test AI features with mock data
- Perform integration testing

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading and pagination
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Use FlatList/ListView efficiently
- Minimize re-renders
- Profile and optimize AI model inference
- Implement proper memory management

### Platform-Specific Features
- Camera and photo library access
- Geolocation services
- Push notifications
- Biometric authentication
- Device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)
- Background processing

### Security Considerations
- Secure storage for sensitive data (Keychain, Keystore)
- Implement certificate pinning
- Validate all user inputs
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Handle permissions properly

## Common AI Features
- Voice commands and speech recognition
- Computer vision (object detection, OCR, AR)
- Personalization and recommendations
- Natural language processing
- Mood and sentiment analysis
- Health and fitness tracking with AI
